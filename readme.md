# Rent Smart
# This website was a course project for CS-410 Software Engineering course at Winona State University.
# The idea of this website was to create a social media based application that would let users quickly and easily find apartments and      places to rent/buy. This website also lets users rate and view landlords or properties to inform future residents of their experiences.
